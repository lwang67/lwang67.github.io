For me, the coolest thing I've learned about programming in R is that R has lots of libraries with a huge variety of applications.

For instance, "TidyVerse" - collection of R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together, 
"ggplot2" - R packages that create lots of plots.

Before using them, we need to install these packages and Load these libraries:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```
