1.what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science -
do you think you’ll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?

R plays a very important role in Data Science. Using R for data science
is very helpful in statistical computing and graphics that we can clean,
analyze, and graph our data. R is widely used for data analysis and
statistical modeling.

I will continue to use R going forward. I want to be a Data Analyst, and
I think R should be my preferred choice because R is purely for
statistics and data analysis, with graphs that are nicer and more
customizable than those in Python.

2.what things are you going to do differently in practice now that
you’ve had this course?

I have learned two program languages, R and Python. After having this R
course, I am going to do differently in practice to choise R than Python
for deep statistical analysis, supported by just a few lines of code and
beautiful data visualizations. For example, I might use R for customer
behavior analysis.

3.what areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring
further?

I have learned some basic models in this course, and I would like to
explore more models by myself, for example, time series models.
