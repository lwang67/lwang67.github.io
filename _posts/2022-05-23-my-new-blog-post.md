## This is my first blog post
What do you think being a data scientist is about? \
A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?\
Data scientists closely follow the “data science process”: data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? \
Differences: In current terms, the fields of data science and statistics differ in a number of ways. The fields differ in modeling processes, the size of data consumed, the types of problems studied, the academic background of the people in the field, and the terminology used. Statisticians need to understand the modeling and structure of data, while data scientists need to understand applied statistics. Statisticians deal with nebulous concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, hypothesis testing, and the proverbial argument between the “frequentists” and “Bayesians.” Data scientists on the other hand, closely follow the “data science process” that is more approachable. Although data scientists and statisticians tend to gather information for similar purposes, their means of data collection are quite different.Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. The two fields also use somewhat different nomenclature to describe the same principles. 

Similarities:  The fields are closely related in the sense that both data science and statistics aim to extract knowledge from data.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\
I can use a tool like R, Python, SAS or even excel to analyze data and found certain patterns from the data, as a graduate student of statistics, I am at an advantage to be a data scientist or statistician after finishing my courses.
 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
