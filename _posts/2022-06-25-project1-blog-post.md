• explaining what you did in the project and any interesting findings

In this project, I created a vignette about contacting the [COVID19 API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc) using functions I created to query, parse, return well-structured data, and then I used the functions to obtain data from the API and do some exploratory data analysis.

This is my first time to do work with interacting API. There are some interesting findings, for example, how to contacting the API using function to query a data frame.



• You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:


– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?

For me, the most difficult part is how to write codes to create the function to query a data frame.



– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?

In this project, I just did some basic exploratory data analysis. In the future, I hope I can do some high-level analysis.
