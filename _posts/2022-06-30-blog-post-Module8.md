## Blog Post 3

For me, the coolest thing I’ve learned about programming in R is that R
has lots of libraries with a huge variety of applications.

For instance, “TidyVerse” - collection of R packages that share common
philosophies and are designed to work together, “ggplot2” - R packages
that create lots of plots.

Before using them, we need to install these packages and Load these
libraries:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```
