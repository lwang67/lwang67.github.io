## Project 2 Blog Post

  - what would you do differently?

If I have more time to do this project, I would like to spend more
effort on feature selection and modeling. I think there would be a
better model than we did.

  - what was the most difficult part for me?

The most difficult part for me is the automation section. This part was
done by my team member Bryan, and he did very good. I learned a lot from
him\!

  - what are my big take-aways from this project?

From this project, I learned that how to do automation. We can write
code that subset a new data and run the summarize and models
automatically. As the parameter change, the report will change. Itâ€™s a
very useful method for report\!
